This project is a sci-fi 2d top-down shooter/survial game. It will start with an animation of a fleet battle between the fictional space civilizations the Federation of Free Worlds and the Zari Imperium over the planet Palxria Prime, a captured Federation of Free Worlds planet. The game will be controlling the protagonist, the captian of the former dreadnought Polaris, and surviving waves of enemies from the Zari garrison on the planet. The game will end with the protagonist survivng long enough for the Federation of the Free Worlds' fleet to beat the Zari Imperium's fleet and retake the planet. I plan to add at least four classes of enemies, including Zari cyborgs, Zari commandos, Zari hover tanks, and Zari mechs. I also want to add five types of weapons including a gauss rifle, a lazer machine gun, a calamity cannon, a plasma shotgun, and an antimatter rocket launcher. I will add in a health system, ammo system, basic crafting mechanics, and perhaps procedural generation. This is very ambitious so we'll see how far I'll get.
You probably won't see the white things like the numbers in the image preview.

I haven't fully worked out everything yet so please wait for more

I am still currently working on the project
